LambdaPad is static site generator written in Erlang. You might think that
sounds crazy, because you think everything cool should be written in Go,
Node.js, or --- if you're an old school hipster --- Ruby.

But LambdaPad doesn't care about being cool. It cares about being
*awesome*. And it is... *awesome*.

This blog is a record of my experiences with LambdaPad.
