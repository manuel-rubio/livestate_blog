excerpt: Why on Earth was Erlang chosen as the language for LambdaPad?

Every site generator seems to be written in Ruby, Python, or Node.js these
days. Screw that. We want something *functional*. We want something
*awesome*. So the Propositional Calculus [^calculus] answered our prayers and gave us
*LambdaPad*.

There are a few principles that show up in this tool, which are inspired by
patterns in function programming:

- Magic is a pariah --- the goal is that behavior be up front and obvious
- Site data and structure is returned itself as data and is acted on by
  LambdaPad --- transformation and other actions are provided as needed, but
  they're not called directly by the site itself

Of course, none of these require *Erlang*. They're just principles and
patterns.

If you use LambdaPad, you'll learn a little a little Erlang --- in the same way
you'll learn a little Python if you use [Hyde](http://hyde.github.io). That's a
good thing. While LambdaPad is not a massively scalable server (heck, it
doesn't even spawn processes, yet --- though parallel execution could be on the
road map!) it's a nice example of an Erlang application. If you're inclined to
dig deeper, your knowledge of Erlang will improve.

That's the idea.
